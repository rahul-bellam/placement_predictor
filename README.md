# placement_predictor

## Introduction

This project aims to predict student placements based on various features using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset, evaluated for performance, and stored for future use. Visualizations are also provided to better understand the decision boundaries created by the classifier.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can clone this repository and install the required dependencies by following the steps below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/placement-prediction.git
cd placement-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Load the Data: The dataset should be loaded and preprocessed before training the model.
Train the Model: The notebook trains a classifier on the preprocessed dataset.
Visualize Decision Regions: The decision regions of the classifier are visualized using mlxtend.
Save the Model: The trained model is serialized and saved using `pickle`
Example:
You can run the Jupyter Notebook to see how the model is trained and how predictions are made.

## Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, feature scaling, and encoding.
Model Training: Uses machine learning classifiers to predict student placement.
Visualization: Plots decision boundaries to visualize how the model separates different classes.
Model Saving: Saves the trained model to a file `(model.pkl)` for later use.

## Dependencies

Python 3.9+
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
mlxtend
Pickle
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib mlxtend pickle
```
## Configuration

You can modify the following in the notebook:

Classifier: Change the classifier used (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees).
Hyperparameters: Modify the hyperparameters of the model for better performance.
Data: Replace the dataset with your own to train a custom model.

## Troubleshooting

Model Not Training Properly: Ensure that your dataset is correctly preprocessed and there are no missing values.
Pickle Error: Make sure that the version of Python and dependencies are consistent when saving and loading the model.
